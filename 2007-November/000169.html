</I>Hi Josh,

I sometimes forget to read through all of my mailinglist connections, 
but this one touched my radar today, so I noticed this message.
Offcourse it is too late for the 0.4 release, but there are some things 
that I want to let you know.

- Recently I tried to get rdiff web running on a server that does not 
have a local MySQL database, so I setup a database on a remote server.
Al was fine until I ran the spider program to fill the database with all 
the repositories. Spidering was OK, but when it tried to write to the 
database, the spider borked with the following message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rdiffWeb/rdw_spider_repos.py&quot;, 
line 41, in &lt;module&gt;
    findReposForAllUsers()
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rdiffWeb/rdw_spider_repos.py&quot;, 
line 37, in findReposForAllUsers
    findReposForUser(user, userDBModule)
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rdiffWeb/rdw_spider_repos.py&quot;, 
line 29, in findReposForUser
    userDBModule.setUserRepos(user, repoPaths)
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/rdiffWeb/db_mysql.py&quot;, line 64, 
in setUserRepos
    cursor.executemany(query, repoPaths)
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/MySQLdb/cursors.py&quot;, line 217, 
in executemany
    self.errorhandler(self, exc, value)
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/MySQLdb/connections.py&quot;, line 
35, in defaulterrorhandler
    raise errorclass, errorvalue
ValueError: incomplete format

I don't know what causes this error but the only thing different between 
this spider and a different spider on a different server is that the 
database is remote. The rights on the database etc are the same.

- A while back we had to do a big restore of a directory that hadn't 
changed for a few months, but 2 days before that restore a lot of data 
got lost and we keep a history of about 16 days for that area. When the 
user tried to do the restore from rdiffweb he only got about half of his 
data. I then did the same restore from the commandline with rdiff-backup 
and I got all the data. This offcourse proofed to us that rdiff-backup 
is doing what it should do, but it also shows us that we can't trust 
rdiff-web to give full restores.

I hope you can do something with this information.

Greetings,
Jan Hugo Prins
