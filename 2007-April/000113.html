</I>
Well, I was thinking of something that wrote extended logging to stdout or the 
log file, that would simply be ignored when in production mode. That would 
help when things are not runnning as expected.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capabilities. For example, to add more parameters or others that might be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; included in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is an architecture that I've been considering: all each user to be
</I>&gt;<i> an &quot;administrator&quot;, but only manage users within their root directory.
</I>&gt;<i> That is, they could add/delete users, etc, but only within their directory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We also need a way to generically store information about users, such as
</I>&gt;<i> preferences. (Sort order, for example.) Is this what you are referring
</I>&gt;<i> to here?
</I>
Well, this is something I need to think about. In a way, make the preferences 
related to the backup script. ie, imagine that a parent directory in a remote 
computer is being backed up. It would be nice if the user could set, for 
example, directories to ignore, so they are not backed up. Again, need to 
think more about this.

&gt;<i> &gt; other mysql dbs, or LDAP. This could help integration with existing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had initially wanted to support native linux user authentication, but
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't find a clean, widely distributed python module that integrates
</I>&gt;<i> with pam. The biggest goal for me with rdiff-web is keeping it easy to
</I>&gt;<i> install and set up. If a user can't install and set up rdiff-web in 5-10
</I>&gt;<i> minutes, then something is wrong, IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm all for separating the authentication and users list, though. I'll
</I>&gt;<i> try to come up with a proposal for this sometime.
</I>
Sure, I was thinking of something like having a switch or a config flag that 
would enable it to use a separate authentication method (say, another mysql 
db/table), but only optional, so the standard method is the 5 minutes setup 
procedure :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - It would be possible that the user could choose their backup
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directories. This would work with the backup script I just talked about,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so they can choose the directories (Need to think more about this)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I suggest is running &quot;rdiff-web-config spiderrepos&quot; via cron every
</I>&gt;<i> 15 minutes or so. (That's what I do.) That way all the user's repos show
</I>&gt;<i> up. Is that what you're talking about?
</I>
I'd be more inclined to let the admin set the repositories, or the user, 
although an automatic discovery approach is not a bad idea. 

&gt;<i> &gt; credentials) - anything?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd welcome suggestions on any of these.
</I>
I'll drop them here as I get them :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; something similar to what we want to have here :). Please,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comments/objections/suggestions are very welcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to avoid a fork, if possible, as well. Right now, the time I
</I>&gt;<i> have available to work on rdiff-web is pretty limited, but I'll see what
</I>&gt;<i> I can do.
</I>
Ok, I have some little time from work devoted to the project, as we need to 
set it up and get it running to suit our needs. Maybe, I could have it in a 
branch or a different repository and from it you (we) could work out what and 
how to integrate it into trunk if you like it :-)
Anyway, I'll let you know as I get some progress, as I've got many things 
going on as well :)

Thanks.
