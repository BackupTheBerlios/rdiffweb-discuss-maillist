<PRE>Hi,

As I said last week, here is a list of what I would like to do on rdiff-web, 
or at least what we would like to use it. The idea we have in the office is 
to have some kind of automated backup system for workstations where the admin 
user creates an entry for each of the users and a nightly backup script will 
retrieve the data from the workstations, possibly by having some remote 
directories mounted or something. This doesn't necessarily need to be part of 
rdiff-web but might be interesting to have it.

So, here there is a list of things I've been thinking:

- Add more logging, depending on whether you are running it in debug mode or 
not. It is useful to have more information when you are debugging or you are 
reading the source code to understand how it works.
- The admin user manages the users. So, I'd like to extend the user admin 
capabilities. For example, to add more parameters or others that might be 
included in the future.
- Separate users authentication from the &quot;users&quot; database, or have it as 
something optional. So, we can have the users database where all the 
information is stored, but use other backends for authentication, such as 
other mysql dbs, or LDAP. This could help integration with existing 
environments.
- It would be possible that the user could choose their backup directories. 
This would work with the backup script I just talked about, so they can 
choose the directories (Need to think more about this)
- Improvements to the browsing interface (nothing specific, just anything that 
could be improved)
- Improve the installation script.
- Improve the status page (it fails when accessing it without credentials)
- anything?

Well, those are the ideas floating in my mind. They don't necessarily need to 
be included into trunk, but it would be nice to have them and, also, not have 
something that is very different from trunk (a specific fork). So, that's 
probably what I am going to start working on to have something similar to 
what we want to have here :). Please, comments/objections/suggestions are 
very welcome.

Again, thanks!
