<PRE>Thanks for your suggestions! A lot of these are things that I've wanted 
to do, but haven't had time. I've interspersed comments below.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said last week, here is a list of what I would like to do on rdiff-web, 
</I>&gt;<i> or at least what we would like to use it. The idea we have in the office is 
</I>&gt;<i> to have some kind of automated backup system for workstations where the admin 
</I>&gt;<i> user creates an entry for each of the users and a nightly backup script will 
</I>&gt;<i> retrieve the data from the workstations, possibly by having some remote 
</I>&gt;<i> directories mounted or something. This doesn't necessarily need to be part of 
</I>&gt;<i> rdiff-web but might be interesting to have it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, here there is a list of things I've been thinking:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Add more logging, depending on whether you are running it in debug mode or 
</I>&gt;<i> not. It is useful to have more information when you are debugging or you are 
</I>&gt;<i> reading the source code to understand how it works.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Not sure about logging at the source code level, but we need logging of 
page accesses, etc. CherryPy supports Apache-style logging, but we need 
a way to specify a log file and have accesses/errors go there. The most 
comment complaints are installation issues, and this would help with that.
&gt;<i> - The admin user manages the users. So, I'd like to extend the user admin 
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities. For example, to add more parameters or others that might be 
</I>&gt;<i> included in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Here is an architecture that I've been considering: all each user to be 
an &quot;administrator&quot;, but only manage users within their root directory. 
That is, they could add/delete users, etc, but only within their directory.

We also need a way to generically store information about users, such as 
preferences. (Sort order, for example.) Is this what you are referring 
to here?
&gt;<i> - Separate users authentication from the &quot;users&quot; database, or have it as 
</I>&gt;<i> something optional. So, we can have the users database where all the 
</I>&gt;<i> information is stored, but use other backends for authentication, such as 
</I>&gt;<i> other mysql dbs, or LDAP. This could help integration with existing 
</I>&gt;<i> environments.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I had initially wanted to support native linux user authentication, but 
couldn't find a clean, widely distributed python module that integrates 
with pam. The biggest goal for me with rdiff-web is keeping it easy to 
install and set up. If a user can't install and set up rdiff-web in 5-10 
minutes, then something is wrong, IMHO.

I'm all for separating the authentication and users list, though. I'll 
try to come up with a proposal for this sometime.
&gt;<i> - It would be possible that the user could choose their backup directories. 
</I>&gt;<i> This would work with the backup script I just talked about, so they can 
</I>&gt;<i> choose the directories (Need to think more about this)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>What I suggest is running &quot;rdiff-web-config spiderrepos&quot; via cron every 
15 minutes or so. (That's what I do.) That way all the user's repos show 
up. Is that what you're talking about?
&gt;<i> - Improvements to the browsing interface (nothing specific, just anything that 
</I>&gt;<i> could be improved)
</I>&gt;<i> - Improve the installation script.
</I>&gt;<i> - Improve the status page (it fails when accessing it without credentials)
</I>&gt;<i> - anything?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'd welcome suggestions on any of these.
&gt;<i> Well, those are the ideas floating in my mind. They don't necessarily need to 
</I>&gt;<i> be included into trunk, but it would be nice to have them and, also, not have 
</I>&gt;<i> something that is very different from trunk (a specific fork). So, that's 
</I>&gt;<i> probably what I am going to start working on to have something similar to 
</I>&gt;<i> what we want to have here :). Please, comments/objections/suggestions are 
</I>&gt;<i> very welcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'd like to avoid a fork, if possible, as well. Right now, the time I 
have available to work on rdiff-web is pretty limited, but I'll see what 
I can do.

Thanks again,
JoshN
