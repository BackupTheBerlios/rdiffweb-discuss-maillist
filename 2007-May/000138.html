Oh, yes. Being apart from rdiffweb has made me thick. If you have a look at 
the patch, I'd appreciate it.

&gt;<i> I've been wanting to rewrite the admin functionality for some time.
</I>&gt;<i> Things that would be nice to accomplish:
</I>&gt;<i> * Allowing users to change their own passwords
</I>
Um, that's something really desirable and not that difficult to implement. 
I'll try to have a look at that. I'm also, as I think I said, working in an 
alternate backend, where you can authenticate to a different db (mysql) by 
specifying the parameters on the config file such as db, table, user, etc...

&gt;<i> * Allowing users to update their list of repositories (i.e. spider for
</I>&gt;<i> new ones.)
</I>
As it is now, the way to update the repositories is to use the spider, right? 
That would walk through the file system and have a look at the repositories 
that exist on the user's main backup directory, right? Sorry, but I haven't 
had much time to have a look at the spider feature. In any case, letting the 
user run such script should not be that difficult, I guess.

&gt;<i> * Allowing users to administrate their root folders, for example add
</I>&gt;<i> sub-users, and those sub-users could add sub-sub-users, etc. This could
</I>&gt;<i> be useful for when administers back up a server that contains multiple
</I>&gt;<i> home directories, and want users to be able to restore files from their
</I>&gt;<i> home folders, without having access to the whole backup.
</I>
Umm, I don't really see the benefit of this compared to the amount of 
complexity that it'd add to the application. 

&gt;<i> * Providing a nice gui in general. The current admin interface is horrible.
</I>
Yes. I believe that I posted comments about changing the URL from something 
like editUser?user=John to something like editUser/John. Also, I'd like to 
change the way it works so when you make a modification to something, you get 
the list or what you were modifying back, instead of a page that only says 
that your modifcation was done.

I'll post as soon as I progress doing stuff on rdiffweb.

Have a nice weekend.
J.
