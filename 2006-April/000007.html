<PRE>The query string parameter might work--certainly Thunderbird would 
recognize it as a different URL and allow the feed to be added. We may 
also need to specify a different authentication realm so that 
Thunderbird saves different username/password sets for the pages.

Web proxies, etc. are only a concern over an unencrypted web connection. 
Using simple HTTP authentication over an unencrypted connection should 
probably be a greater concern, anyway, since your credentials are sent 
in the clear at fixed intervals. (Digest authentication would offer some 
benefit, but it certainly doesn't beat SSL.)

There's another situation where this might be helpful. A network 
administrator may want to monitor the results of all backups running at 
an organization, to better provide support when backups fail. Although 
it would be reasonable to restrict his access to the data, his ability 
to monitor to backup jobs could be very important. (Admittedly, I have 
no actual scenario where this is happening, but it seems quite possible.)

I dislike adding the complexity of multiple roots to solve this 
problem--it seems like a high cost with marginal benefit. Another 
solution that I think would offer greater advantage is a hierarchical 
user list. Certain users could be sub-users of another account. 
Entrypoints that currently receive a repository path (browse, restore, 
etc.) would also receive the username. The usernames could be interfaced 
as tabs or could simply be included in another column in the table, but 
it should only be displayed if the user has sub-accounts that he or she 
oversees. RSS feeds would be available for all sub-users (combined) or 
for any single user (individually).

I don't think my needs merit all this framework, but if rdiffWeb does 
implement user permissions or user management, designing it to support 
this use case may be of minimal additional cost.
