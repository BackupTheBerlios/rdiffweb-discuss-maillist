<PRE>Thanks for all your work on this! Comments are interspersed below.

&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recently came across rdiffWeb because I was looking to implement something 
</I>&gt;<i> similar for our office, as we use rdiff-backup extensively. I've been testing 
</I>&gt;<i> rdiffweb and it's very nice. Thanks for writing it :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As it doesn't entirely suit our needs as it is now, we would like to extend it 
</I>&gt;<i> by adding new features and improvements that we think could be useful for all 
</I>&gt;<i> rdiffweb users. So I was thinking that I could send the patches and changes I 
</I>&gt;<i> make so you can review them and get them into trunk if possible, so we would 
</I>&gt;<i> keep closer to trunk :-). If that could be possible, I'd be vert grateful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To start with it, attached there is a patch that fixes a small problem with 
</I>&gt;<i> rdiffweb as it is now. Rdiffweb lets you enter a non validated path that lets 
</I>&gt;<i> you walk down the file system hierachy as 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://localhost:8080/browse/?repo=b&amp;path=..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc">http://localhost:8080/browse/?repo=b&amp;path=..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc</A>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Wow, if that is really the case, then that is a huge hole. I can't 
reproduce this, however -- I get an &quot;Access Denied&quot; page, as expected. 
(The ensurePathValid function is supposed to protect against this.) Can 
you give me an example of when it happens? What server OS are you running?
&gt;<i> I've also modified the page_locations.py file and the repo_listing.html 
</I>&gt;<i> template in order to have separate loops for the repos that work and the ones 
</I>&gt;<i> that have some kind of error.
</I>&gt;<i> You'll find random changes and comments I added while I was reading the source 
</I>&gt;<i> code, for the sake of clarity and understanding (still reading source 
</I>&gt;<i> code) :-) Also added a primary key to the repos table, so it is easier to 
</I>&gt;<i> handle it (for example, to delete any given row)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'd prefer not to add this, unless we have migration code. I don't want 
users to have to run the install over again. (It's enough of a pain to 
run it once! :-) ) One thing I've been thinking of adding is a framework 
for detecting version, and being able to change the db appropriately.
&gt;<i> Lastly, I've noticed that all the files are indented using 3 spaces. I was 
</I>&gt;<i> wondering if it could be changed to 4 spaces as that is what most python 
</I>&gt;<i> applications are written with and definitely would make things easier for 
</I>&gt;<i> other developers :-)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I don't mind switching, but I'd like a more conclusive case that most 
python apps are written using 4 spaces. Examples?
&gt;<i> In any case, let me know what you think, and keep up the good work :-)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'm still reading through your changes, and will probably comment more 
later. Thanks again!
