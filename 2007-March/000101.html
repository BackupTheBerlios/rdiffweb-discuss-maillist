<PRE>Hi All,

I recently came across rdiffWeb because I was looking to implement something 
similar for our office, as we use rdiff-backup extensively. I've been testing 
rdiffweb and it's very nice. Thanks for writing it :-)

As it doesn't entirely suit our needs as it is now, we would like to extend it 
by adding new features and improvements that we think could be useful for all 
rdiffweb users. So I was thinking that I could send the patches and changes I 
make so you can review them and get them into trunk if possible, so we would 
keep closer to trunk :-). If that could be possible, I'd be vert grateful.

To start with it, attached there is a patch that fixes a small problem with 
rdiffweb as it is now. Rdiffweb lets you enter a non validated path that lets 
you walk down the file system hierachy as 
<A HREF="http://localhost:8080/browse/?repo=b&amp;path=..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc">http://localhost:8080/browse/?repo=b&amp;path=..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc</A>

I've also modified the page_locations.py file and the repo_listing.html 
template in order to have separate loops for the repos that work and the ones 
that have some kind of error.
You'll find random changes and comments I added while I was reading the source 
code, for the sake of clarity and understanding (still reading source 
code) :-) Also added a primary key to the repos table, so it is easier to 
handle it (for example, to delete any given row)

Lastly, I've noticed that all the files are indented using 3 spaces. I was 
wondering if it could be changed to 4 spaces as that is what most python 
applications are written with and definitely would make things easier for 
other developers :-)

In any case, let me know what you think, and keep up the good work :-)

Cheers.
