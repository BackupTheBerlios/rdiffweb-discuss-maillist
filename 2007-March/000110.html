Ok, but as it is now, it doesn't work for me. Accessing the root directory of 
one of my defined repositories gives me an access denied error.


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I stored the rootDir in a session variable for easy access as it

</I>&gt;<i> I agree, though I don't like the way that it is initialized. We should

Sure. I don't like it either. I am still learning about cherrypy and am not 
that proficient with it. 

&gt;<i> I'm okay with the change to 4 spaces, though I'm not excited about a
</I>&gt;<i> blanket change. I'll look into this soon. Perhaps I can convert
</I>&gt;<i> everything over in a single patch. As for the other stuff, I simply
</I>&gt;<i> haven't had time to look at it.
</I>
Well, attached is a patch to change everything into 4 spaces and also, a bit 
of bash scripting that I used for converting it. You have to execute it in 
every directory that contains .py files and execute it manualy for rdiff-web 
and rdiff-web-config. Let me know what you think and thanks for changing :)


&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, I'll keep reading the source code and will be back with more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stuff as soon as I have some more time to devote to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great! I'd be interested in everything you have to offer. One thing that
</I>&gt;<i> I've thought about is adding a plugin-style system, so that users can
</I>&gt;<i> add hooks to do whatever custom things that they want. What do you think?
</I>
Yes, that would be great, but I'd focus first in getting things right and then 
adding that extra functionality. If I have some more free time later this 
evening, which seems unlikely to me atm, I'll elaborate an email of what I've 
been finding and what I'd like to suggest/improve/comment on. 

Anyway, thank you very much.
