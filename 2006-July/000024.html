Hmmm.... Interesting... That would be a start I guess.
I'm personally looking at a hybrid system of push and pull. A cronjob
every 2hours or so, backing up a number of machines... BUT, on the
laptops, a special script, that would 'call home' when connected to
the home network, and inform the server of it's presence, and ask for
a backup to be done.
My biggest concern, is for machines that don't get a complete backup.
As 2 of the laptops are OS X, I'm not 100% sure the best way to go
about trying to ensure they get complete backups, as they are on a
number of networks, and sometimes don't stay connected for long. So
having them call home, was IMHO the best way.

The reason I want all the backups to be 'pull' is for security. I have
one public key, all the 'client's' get as a trusted key, and the
server has the private key. Oh, and on the clients, the key is read
only. My idea being, that way, only the server has write access to the
backup area, and the clients, or hacked clients, can't get to the
backups.

I assume that it is possible to do it in reverse, so that the key the
clients has, allows them to run rdiff-backup on the server, in server
mode only, but does this allow for writing? I still feel that having
the server being in 'control' is easiest.

As for laptop's calling home, I was thinking some sort of queue
system, and a url. The client 'pings' the url, which tells my queue
system to backup that machine, unless a backup is in progress.

I'm also thinking of a 'config' format for all of this, and a runner
that monitors last successful backup, and emails if a backup hasn't
run for awhile.

Now I think of it, it is like BackupPC.

Curious, why do you say rdiff-backup is more of a push style backup?
To me, it appears to be ether. Although now I think about it. Having
push style, rather than every 2 hours pull, would solve part of my
issue with trying to workout how many revisions to keep... Cause I'll
have a heap less ;-)
