<PRE>My guess is that the setting somehow isn't being saved to the database. 

The reason that it persists for the session is that it's cached in memory.



The database is in /etc/rdiffweb/rdw.db. You can run:

# sqlite3 /etc/rdiffweb/rdw.db

to view the database, then enter &quot;select * from users&quot; to list the users 

and their base directories. Is the directory correct in the database?
Thanks for the help.  It looks as though the path is being correctly saved 
to the database, and unfortunately, the problem is intermittent.  Sometimes 
it has the correct path when I log in remotely, and sometimes it reverts to 
the old incorrect path.

I don't know why I didn't try this first, but it appears that if I simply 
reload the page, it usually corrects the problem.  So I don't know if it's a 
bug in firefox, a network latency issue, or something else?  I tried it on 
several machines which had never tried to connect to an rdiffweb page before 
(so the page couldn't be cached) and got approximately the same result - 
first login had the Backup Locations shown with &quot;Error&quot;, 0 size, and 
clicking on the (more) under History gave an error that the location doesn't 
exist - under Admin, it shows the old backup path.  Clicking refresh fixed 
the problem either the first or second time I hit it.

So I'm stuck as to why I have this problem, but I do have an effective 
workaround (reload the page!), so it's not the biggest problem in the world.
