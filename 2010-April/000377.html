<PRE>So, I have 3 machines (will be 25 machines when we finish the rollout) that 
are backing up to a network drive. The network drive is mounted on each 
machine at /mnt/backup/.  Meanwhile, I have an rdiff-backup script that runs 
every 3 hours that backs up to /mnt/backup/$(hostname).  When I originally 
set up rdiffweb on these machines, I pointed it at /mnt/backup/ for the 
default backup directory.  However, I want to change this to 
/mnt/backup/str04-fs, /mnt/backup/str05-fs, etc...  based on the name of the 
machine.

I'm fine with logging in to the web interface to make this change (would be 
nice if it was automatic, but not essential).  But when I go into the web 
interface, log in as admin, go to the admin settings tab, click edit user, 
and change the directory (and then click save changes), it only seems to 
apply for the rest of the session.  I can go to preferences and redetect 
shares, and they show up.  Until I log out and back in again.  At that 
point, the shares show &quot;not found&quot;, and when I go back to edit the user, it 
shows his default directory as /mnt/backup/ again.  It's driving me nuts.

I'm using 0.6.3.  I've noticed that someone had done some patches and posted 
them on this mailing list, but from the archives it doesn't seem like you 
can get attachments.  Is there somewhere else to get them, and will they 
solve the problem?  Or does someone else have a workaround where I can fix 
the backup directory?  There doesn't seem to be a setting in the .conf file, 
so I'm assuming that info is stored in the db?
